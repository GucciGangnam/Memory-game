# Description of project 
This project was a part of the Odin Course to design a memory game using React. 
Its the first project in the course that uses React.

## note 
i started the React section of the course earlier last week.  However, i quickly noticed that the information in the Odin Project was not up to date with current react versions and rest assured confusion hit hard. 

I decided to take a step back and do some research on the current state of React and how to use it.  I used teh odin projects topic to start researching each topic on my own. 
mainly states, some hooks, and components.

however, during this time.  The odin project actually underwent a major update to their react section and the entire section was removed so I ahd to learn react without and direction as to what steps to take.  

This wasnt easy for me, youtube is a rabbithole and its hard to know what i need to learn without a clear path.  

I knew the project was to make a memory game so I started coding.  I quickly found myself out of depth and relied heavily on a tutorial from WebNinja. 

## What I learned
I learned a lot about React and how to use it.  I learned how to use states, how to use hooks, how to use components, and how to use props.  I also learned how to use the useEffect hook. 

I also learnt a lot more about array methods and how to use more of them.  

## What I struggled with
grasping the concept of React.. I felt liek a lot of the things i was doing coudl have been done with vanilla JS.  
Also, leaning opn a tutorial to walk me through wasnt the best idea. I wasnt able to write my own psudocode and struggled with having to contain my code to the tutorial.
